a Fork of # bitluni's ESP32 VGA
A simple VGA output with 14Bit color and external DACs over parallel I²S

This is a Hardware Only Fork, meaning that I have designed my OWN PCB Layout to use with this library.
I do not use only one type of ESP32 Breakout board, thus having a "generic" type of VGA only "board"
that I can connect to any of my ESP32 type boards, as needed made sense.
